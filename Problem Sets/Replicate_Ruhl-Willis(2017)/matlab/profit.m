function Pi = profit(X, Evalue, Qvalue, theta, Cstar, alphan, alphak, w, r)
% Profit function for a plant in new exporter dynamics of Ruhl, Willis (2013)
% X is the export decision. X = 0 and 1
% Qvalue and Evalue are realizations of simulated AR(1) processes
% theta is the elasticity of substitution
% Cstar is the size of world aggregate demand relative to domestic demand
% alphan and alphak are parameters of the Copp-Douglas production function
% w is wage, r is the rent price of capital 
% State space is X, Epsilon and Q

% Not fastest, but clear
M = (1 + X * (Qvalue^theta) * Cstar)^(1/theta) * Evalue;
%define two cobb douglas coefficients
a = alphan * (theta - 1)/theta;
b = alphak * (theta - 1)/theta;
Pi = (1-a-b) * M^(1/(1-a-b)) * (a/w)^(a/(1-a-b)) * (b/r)^(b/(1-a-b));
